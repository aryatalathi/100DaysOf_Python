1. Day11 : Given an array of size N, find the smallest positive integer value that cannot be represented as sum of some elements from the array.
2. Day12 : Given N non-negative integers a1,a2,....an where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). 
N vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i,0). 
Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that it contains the most water.
3. Day13 : Ben and Jim are playing a Dice game alternatively (Ben starts the game). They both roll the dice alternatively and the one with the most number of Even Outcomes wins the game.
If both have the same number of even outcomes then Ben wins. Find out the winner.
4. Day14 : Given an array arr[] of size N where every element is in the range from 0 to n-1. Rearrange the given array so that arr[i] becomes arr[arr[i]].
5. Day15 : Given an unsorted array arr[] of n positive integers. Find the number of triangles that can be formed with three different array elements as lengths of three sides of triangles. 
6. Day16 : Given a string S, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
7. Day17 : Given a string without spaces, the task is to remove duplicates from it. The original order of characters must be kept the same. 
8. Day 18 : Given a string s consisting only lower case alphabets, find the minimum number of changes required to it so that all substrings of the string become distinct.
9. Day 19 : N balls are arranged in a row. The initial color of each ball is represented by string S of length N. The ball is painted black if the ith character of the string is ′B′ and white if the ith character of the string is ′W′. You want to repaint some of the balls black or white so that none of the two adjacent balls having the same color.
            Find how many balls you have to repaint to satisfy the above condition
10. Day 20 : Count of strings that can be formed using a, b and c under given constraints
