1. Day 21 : Given two strings X and Y of lengths m and n respectively, find the length of the smallest string which has both, X and Y as its sub-sequences.
Note: X and Y can have both uppercase and lowercase letters.
2. Day 22: Anagram or Not
A string is said to be an anagram of a string if it is created by rearranging the characters which are present in string
3. Day 23 : Given a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. Sort the array into a wave-like array and return it. 
In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that a1 >= a2 <= a3 >= a4 <= a5..... (considering the increasing lexicographical order).
3. Day 24 : Given an array of size N containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s; sort the array in ascending order. 
4. Day 25 : Case-specific Sorting of Strings : Given a string S consisting of uppercase and lowercase characters. The task is to sort uppercase and lowercase letters separately 
such that if the ith place in the original string had an Uppercase character then it should not have a lowercase character after being sorted and vice versa.
