1. Day 41 : Given a singly linked list and a key, count the number of occurrences of given key in the linked list.
2. Day 42 : Given a linked list of size N, your task is to complete the function isLengthEvenOrOdd() which contains head of the linked list and check whether the length of linked list is even or odd.
3. Day 43 : Given a Singly Linked List of size N, delete all alternate nodes of the list.
4. Day 44 : Given a doubly linked list, rotate the linked list counter-clockwise by P nodes. Here P is a given positive integer and is smaller than the count of nodes(N) in a linked list.
5. Day 45 : Given a doubly linked list of n elements. The task is to reverse the doubly linked list.
6. Day 46 : Given a singly linked list of size N of integers. The task is to check if the given linked list is palindrome or not.
7. Day 47 : Given a singly linked list L0 -> L1 -> â€¦ -> Ln-1 -> Ln. Rearrange the nodes in the list so that the new formed list is: L0 -> Ln -> L1 -> Ln-1 -> L2 -> Ln-2.
