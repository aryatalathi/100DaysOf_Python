7. Problem Solving
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Day1 : Reverse that number and print it
2. Day2 : Balanced number or not
3. Day3 : Some people are standing in a queue. A selection process follows a rule where people standing on even positions are selected. Of the selected people a queue is formed and again out of these only people on even position are selected. This continues until we are left with one person. Find out the position of that person in the original queue
4.  Day4 : An analog clock which consists of two hands one for hour and another for minute. Calculate the shorter angle formed between hour and minute hand at any given time.
5.  Day5 : Check whether given number is perfect or not; Perfect Numbers are integers that are equal to the sum of all its divisors except that number itself.
6.  Day6 : Given four integers A, B, C, N. A, B, C represents the first three numbers of geek-onacci series. Find the Nth number of the series. The nth number of geek-onacci series is a sum of the last three numbers (summation of N-1th, N-2th, and N-3th geek-onacci numbers)
7.  Day7 : Given a sorted array of positive integers. Rearrange  the array elements alternatively i.e first element should be max value, second should be min value, third should be second max, fourth should be second min and so on.
8.  Day8 : Given a sorted array containing only 0s and 1s, find the transition point. 
9.  Day9 : Given an array consisting of N integers. Find the maximum length of an increasing subarray of the given array.
10.  Day10 : Given an array arr[] of N non-negative integers representing the height of blocks. If width of each block is 1, compute how much water can be trapped between the blocks during the rainy season.
