1. Day 51 : Given two linked lists of size N and M, which are sorted in non-decreasing order. The task is to merge them in such a way that the resulting list is in decreasing order.
2. Day 52 : Given a singly linked list consisting of N nodes. The task is to remove duplicates (nodes with duplicate values) from the given list (if exists).
Note: Try not to use extra space. Expected time complexity is O(N). The nodes are arranged in a sorted way.
3. Day 53 : Given an unsorted linked list of N nodes. The task is to remove duplicate elements from this unsorted Linked List. When a value appears in multiple nodes, the node which appeared first should be kept, all others duplicates are to be removed.
